### About

Currently, I've simply cleaned up my old experimental code and placed it here. I plan to write a cleaner version with comprehensive instructions and annotations later (hopefully by November :p). However, the code provided here should already be functional and capable of reproducing the results presented in our paper.

For guys interested in our work, we **recommend** checking our [1D toy case demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UENmBsCueM-yPOfaS1YqQ6lC9BPxALwV?usp=sharing). 

This simple demo effectively showcases the key concepts and should be enjoyable to go through. Plus, it’s quick and won’t take much of your time!
